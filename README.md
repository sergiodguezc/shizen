# Shizen
Shizen is a bio-based algorithm library written in Haskell. It uses the
Accelerate Library to parallelize the algorithms generating CUDA code or LLVM
code.  The name Shizen (自然) is the Japanese word for nature. 

The library is still in development and the API is not stable.  The library
currently contains the following algorithms:
    - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)  (complete, testing)
    - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (complete, tested)
    - Differential Evolution (DE) (complete, tested)
